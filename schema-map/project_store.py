schema-map/project_store.py

Persistence for Projects and their Versions — the foundation everything
in Schema Map's v2 design sits on top of (Editor, Clusters-per-project,
DDL export). A "Project" is the top-level container the owner always
starts from, seeded one of three ways (direct database connection, from
scratch, or a pasted custom-query JSON result) — none of that origin
logic lives here, this module only knows how to store and retrieve
whatever schema snapshot it's handed.

Storage: a single SQLite file at /app/data/schema-map/projects.db,
deliberately NOT the same database as whatever Postgres the owner is
exploring or designing — this is only ever Schema Map's own memory of
its projects. SQLite (not Postgres, not a new service) because it needs
zero new infrastructure and no new dependency (stdlib `sqlite3`),
matching this whole repo's "one container, no new services" rule (see
../CLAUDE.md). The file must live on the `schema_map_data` Docker volume
(see ../docker-compose.yml) — without that mount, every image rebuild
would silently erase every project and its entire version history,
since a container's own writable layer doesn't survive a rebuild.

Versioning model (decided after explicit back-and-forth, not a default):
every version is a COMPLETE, INDEPENDENT snapshot of the schema at that
point — never a diff against the previous version. This is deliberate:
it's what makes "delete any one version" always safe (nothing else can
depend on it structurally), at the cost of some storage duplication
between consecutive versions. That cost is absorbed by gzip-compressing
each snapshot before writing it (schema JSON — table/column/constraint
names — compresses very well, commonly 5-10x), not by adding diffing —
diffing was considered and rejected specifically because it would make
deleting a middle version either break later versions or require a
"repair the chain" step, both of which contradict the owner's explicit
requirement that delete is simple, explicit, and never cascades.
